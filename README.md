# opDavi1.github.io -- Going to be replaced soon

This is my own personal website designed to look like a really bad early 2000s website.
You can find it [here](https://opdavi1.com/) at opdavi1.com or *opDavi1.github.io* redirects to it.

Early 2000s website will be replaced soon with a slightly better looking portfolio-type website
